Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
Software engineering can be defined as an engineer who requires, designs, implements (develop), tests, deploys, and maintains high-quality software systems for usage. 

The importance of software engineering in the Technology industry is that software engineering makes communication easier, makes it easier for people to interact with others around the world to do business, makes it easier for people to have access to healthcare, and makes it easier for people to entertain themselves.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. software engineering developed programming languages in the 1960s, e.g., Fortran. C
2. The software engineering developed an advent of structures programming in the 1970s.
3. The software engineering developed the rising of an agile metodologis in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4. Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment: Releasing the software to users and customers.
6. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Agile Methodology
Agile methodology is characterized by its iterative and flexible approach to software development. It emphasizes collaboration among cross-functional teams and prioritizes adaptability to changing requirements throughout the development process. Mobile App Development: An app like Instagram evolves through continuous user feedback, with regular updates and new features being released in short cycles.

Waterfall Methodology
Waterfall methodology follows a linear and sequential approach to software development, with distinct phases such as requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach, where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. Changes are difficult to incorporate once a phase is completed. Less Frequent Changes: - Example: Industries like healthcare or aviation, where changes are infrequent and heavily regulated, may find Waterfall advantageous since it emphasizes thorough documentation and adherence to standards.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

A Software Developer writes code and implements the software solutions.
A Quality Assurance Engineer is an engineer who ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
The project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software suite that consolidates basic tools required to write, debug and test code. Eg visual studio, eclipse.

Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps in recording changes made to files by keeping a track of modifications done in the code and cordinating work among team members. E.g Git, Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.  

The challenges are: changing requirements, tight deadlines, and technical debt.

Strategies For Overcoming Challenges are effective communication, agile metodologis, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing is when testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration testing is testing the interaction between different components or subsystem.
System testing is when testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance testing is when testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs. 

Their important in software quality assurance is that they make ensure that the software products meet specified quality standards and functional requirements.

Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering can be defined as an engineer who craft questions or statements to get the best possible response from AI models

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Example: LETTER OF INTENT TO RUN FOR CHAIRMAN OF OJOKORO LCDA IN 2025

Because the more specification the input is, the more relevant the result I get.
